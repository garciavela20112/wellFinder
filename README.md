# WellFinder

## Inspiration
Helping others is a noble action, but we need to do it effectively. Oftentimes there is a discrepancy between the money that is thrown at such noble causes and what actually happens on the ground to improve the lives of the people that need it the most. For example, when tackling the scarcity of access to clean waters in countries like Ethiopia, we found striking evidence that many wells built with good intentions often fail to deliver on their promises, either drying up or being inaccessible. Therefore, we wanted to create an app that could suggest optimal well locations by taking into consideration a multifactorial analysis, ranging from population densities to groundwater availability and geological terrain. Moreover, we also want to give comprehensive information to people who are willing to invest in well-construction.

## What it does

We came up with an application that shows the locations of suggested wells, detailed information about the well, and satellite viewing of the well location.

## What's next for WellFinder

1. More data would be needed to assess more accurately well location. Surveys by experts and further analysis to determine appropriate locations of wells would be beneficial as well.
2. Expanding WellFinder for a campaign for other causes forest conservation, food shelters, and clothes services.
